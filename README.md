Description:
The Work Order Management System is a web application designed to make the creation, assignment, and tracking of work orders easier to handle. It allows the admin to assign contractors to specific job sites and to turn job requests into active work orders. From here, the system can then generate invoices (when the job is complete), monitor the progress of the job, and update those work orders. Overall, it is designed to connect contractors with jobs around the city in an organized manner.
